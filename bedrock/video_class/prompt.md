According to the above classification information.
Understand the video content and provide corresponding category and tags. Output 2 pieces of information: one is category, the other is tags. 
1. The category is a array of objects, and each object has three properties: catetory1, catetory2, and catetory3. catetory1 and catetory2 are strings, and catetory3 is an array of strings. The weight property is a dictionary that maps each category to its corresponding weight. The weight is an integer between 0 and 100. The array length of category is 1 to 3. Based on your understanding of the video, output the number of categories in the array.
2. The tags are an array of objects, and each object has two properties: tag and scores. The tag is a string, and the scores is an integer between 0 and 100. The array length of tags is 1 to 5.
